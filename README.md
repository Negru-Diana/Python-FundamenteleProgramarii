# 🎬 Movie Rental Management System

The *"Inchiriere_Filme"* project is a Python-based application designed to simulate a movie rental system. It serves as a practical demonstration of key programming concepts, such as modularity, data management, and error handling.


## 🌟 Key Features

-  🎯 **Modular Design**: The layered architecture ensures clear separation of concerns, enhancing both code comprehension and maintainability.

-  🔍 **Input Validation**: Strong validation rules ensure the integrity and consistency of user data, preventing errors and inconsistencies.

-  📤 **Full CRUD Functionality**: The system supports full lifecycle management for clients, movies, and rentals, offering a complete solution for rental transactions.

-  📑 **Sorting & Filtering**: Advanced query options allow users to filter and sort data, improving efficiency in finding specific information.
  
-  🎲 Random Data Generation – Users can generate random movies and clients, making it easier to test and simulate rental scenarios.

-  🛠️ **Robust Error Handling**: The system gracefully handles errors, ensuring stability even when faced with invalid inputs or unexpected scenarios.


## 🗂️ Data Persistence

The system employs a file-based data storage approach, which is easy to implement and maintain:

-  *clienti.txt* — Stores client information.

-  *filme.txt* — Contains movie records.

-  *inchirieri.txt* — Logs rental transactions.





## 🔬 Technical Highlights
-  **Language**: Python

-  **Architecture**: Multi-layered architecture (Domain, Repository, Service, UI)

-  **Data Persistence**: File-based system using structured text files for storing records

-  **Error Management**: Comprehensive validation and exception handling
